# NoteTaker
This project was developed using React and TypeScript. I made this to learn developemnt of applications with the use of TypeScript. Used ReactMarkdown to make the Note-taking fully markdown supported with categories. Used BootStrap CSS to design all the front-end UI components and styling.
